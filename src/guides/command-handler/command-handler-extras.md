# Command Handler Extras

**As we have a basic command Handler , Let's talks about some features.**

## Features

### Callback Commands Handlers

* LoadCommands has a reserved property named **"type"** which determines the type of the command .
* By default , it's set to **"default"** which is our bot.command.so if we set the value of type, we can also set the type of command we want it to be load as.

#### Example

* For Example,we are making a command for **"bot.onMessageDelete()"** Callback.
* after adding **"bot.onMessageDelete()"** in your mainFile , add this code by creating a new file inside moderation folder.

```javascript
module.exports = {
   channel:"$channelId",
   name:"deleteLog", // name property is not necessary it's just for logging the command (if this is not present channel property will be used for logging)
   type:"messageDelete",
   code:`
     A message was deleted!!
     Message:"$message"`
   }
```

#### logged

* now run the project.Check! the command has been logged as messageDelete , which means that your command will be executed , when someone deletes the message

#### Types

* You can check all the available types in [here](../../options/commandTypes.md)

### Update commands

\*Using LoadCommands class also enables a special function: **"$updateCommands"**.

This function updates all the new changes to the commands without restarting!

### Multiple Commands On Same File

* LoadCommands.load() Accept arrays in module.exports,which means, You can also add multiple Commands in Same File!

#### Example

* Right now we have 2 files **"deletelog.js"** and **"selfkick.js"**

Lets Combine Them!

```javascript
 module.exports = [{
    channel:"$channelId",
    name:"deleteLog", // name property is not necessary it's just for logging the command (if this is not present channel property will be used for logging)
    type:"messageDelete",
    code:`
      A message was deleted!!
      Message:"$message"
`
    },{
  name:"selfkick",
  aliases:["sk","bye","exit"],
  code:`
  $kick[$authorId]
`
}]
```

#### logged

* now run the project.Check! both commands are logged now. ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot\_2021-08-06-16-09-09-49.png)
