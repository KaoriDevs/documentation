## Examples

```javascript
bot.command({
  name: "ban",
  code: `
  $username[$mentioned] has been banned from the guild.
  
  $ban[$guildID;$mentioned;7;$noMentionMessage]
  `
// Deleted 7 days of messages the user
// ðŸ’¡ That's also called as "soft-ban"

* Without deleting user's messages on the guild:

```javascript
bot.command({
  name: "ban",
  code: `
  $username[$message] has been banned from the guild.
  
  $ban[$guildID;$message;0;$noMentionMessage]
  `
// Didn't delete any messages of the user, but banned
});
```
