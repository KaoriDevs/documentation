### Usage

```php
$wait[time]
```

### Field

| Field | Description   | Type   | Required |
| ----- | ------------- | ------ | -------- |
| time  | delaying time | string | yes      |

#### Suffixes

* `s` - Seconds
* `m` - Minutes
* `h` - Hours
* `d` - Days
* `w` - Weeks

**Footnote**

_`$wait` is not saved in the database, be aware of that!\[^1]_

## Examples

* Delaying the whole code:

```javascript
bot.command({
  name: "wait",
  code: `
  $description[1;Sorry for late reply, eheh :D]
  
  $title[1;Hello!]
  
  $wait[5s]
  ` 
// since $wait is at bottom, it will delay whole code
});
```

* To delay certain parts of the code:

```javascript
bot.command({
  name: "wait",
  code: `
  $sendMessage[Bye ðŸ‘‹]
  
  $wait[5s]
  
  $sendMessage[Hi ðŸ™Œ]
  `
});
//'Hi' will respond instantly, but 'Bye' will be delayed for 5 seconds before sending
```

\[^1]: You can go up to 20-24 days, but bot should be still running.
